# Hello. Thanks for being a part of this wonderful team.

## DESCRIPTION 

We're building <strong>GIGS</strong> - A website where creators of art (e.g: writers, digital creators, etc)can upload their work and make money from it. For the Nigerian and African creator at large.

## CONTRIBUTION

- To make a contribution to this awesome repository, You need to follow the following steps to achieve that;
### 1. Fork this repository

 This is done by clicking on the fork on the top of the page. This will create copy of this repository in your account.

### 2. Clone the repository

 Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied" 
```
For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/your-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the `pjt-j4-frontend` repository on GitHub to your computer.

## 3. Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd pjt-j4-frontend 
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
 ```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b mytask
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _mytask_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your task to the repo.)

## 4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add <your-file> ``` or ``` git add . ``` to add all files.
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add mytask to the repo"
```

replacing `mytask` with what you want to use as the commit message but make sure it is reasonable to what you did. 

## 5. Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## 6. Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

### Some extra things to keep in mind while coding
Write code for:
1. Readability
- Imagine the person reviewing your code has an axe and knows your house address
3. Modularity
- How easy is it to reuse bits of your code?
- When you have an error, how easy is it to narrow down to the exact section of code that's responsible for a problem
4. Efficiency
- How fast does this work?
5. Length

### <strong>Thank you in advance for contributing to the success of this project!</strong>
